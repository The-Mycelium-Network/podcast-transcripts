# The Mycelium Network Podcast Episode Two with Isabel Calabig

**Schalk Neethling**

Welcome, Isabel. Thank you for joining.

**Isabel Calabig**

Yeah, thanks for having me.

**Schalk Neethling**

It’s a pleasure. I discovered you on Twitter when I saw your tweet that said, “Let’s start a call and connect. This is for anyone who wants encouragement finding a job in tech and exploring a web dev career.” Is that something you do regularly?

**Isabel Calabig**

Yeah. I’m actually fairly active on Twitter. I’m definitely the type that’s just all about community and uplifting people learning to code. It’s not easy doing it alone. And so I think the community is just an essential part of anybody’s coding journey.

**Schalk Neethling**

That’s for sure. So, the Mycelium Network is set up for precisely this. To help people who are early-stage web developers. It’s focused on web developers but not exclusively for web developers. I also tend to use the naming early-stage web developer. I use that phrasing instead of a beginner because I think the word beginner has gotten a bit of a bad rap.
Early-stage developer sounds a bit different because you might have coding experience but don’t know JavaScript. You may know, for example, C, but you’re new to JavaScript. You’re new to HTML. You’re new to CSS.

It’s not always a career switch from being a non-coder to a coder, but from enterprise to ed-tech. That’s also a change because the problem set is different, and how you solve these problems may differ.
So again, you’re new to something, you’re a beginner at something. So with all of that in mind, what is your story? What is your history? I know that you didn’t start as a coder. If I understand correctly, it’s something that you’re transitioning into.

**Isabel Calabig**

In my case, I actually have a background in marketing, specifically within the mental health field. And was working in marketing within the mental health field for about two years. And I guess during COVID, I started to think about what really interested me and what I wanted my career to be.

And at the time, it still is; tech has been trending. And so that definitely gave me the incentive, and I wanted to see how I could get involved. So moving forward, I now work as a marketing operations associate for an ed-tech company called DreamBox.

Networking and knowing how to create landing pages with basic HTML and CSS landed me a job in tech. And so, I’m still kind of in the process of onboarding and training because I literally just got the job a few weeks ago. I’m helping our web developers develop the company landing pages, so that’s where I’m now.

**Schalk Neethling**

That’s great. Can you tell us a little bit more about DreamBox? It sounds fascinating.

**Isabel Calabig**

DreamBox Learning is an ed-tech company that focuses on adaptive technology. So they try to make a software or program curriculum that adapts to a student’s learning. And so it’s a very personalized approach to a student’s education. And not just the student in their learning journey but also the educator can track and see what the student is missing. So it’s a pretty impressive technology that our company is involved in.

**Schalk Neethling**

That sounds incredibly interesting. I know from people I’ve spoken to that one of the things they find tricky, besides just finding good content, is finding something that fits their learning style. So having something that can adapt to your learning style is interesting.

So as you are new to tech, and I know from speaking to previous guests and, in general, speaking to early-stage folk, there are a lot of challenges when you’d like to walk into this new world. So for you, what are the challenges you’ve faced?

**Isabel Calabig**

I can probably go off on the numerous challenges I’m facing. Still, I think the common denominator, the root of it all, is just imposter syndrome. I would have these constant thoughts like I’m not smart enough, don’t know enough math, or I’m a slow learner, or even something like, I don’t deserve to be in tech. That kind of thinking just really hits hard sometimes, you know.

I don’t know. Maybe it’s also just nowadays; I feel like people put tech at such a high standard or pedestal. You have to be a certain somebody to get into tech, but honestly, anyone can do it. Anyone can learn how to code. I never imagined myself being able to learn HTML, CSS, and now JavaScript. Growing up, my dad was a software engineer, and he never actually pushed me to look into web development. Still, I knew that he knew that I had an interest in it.

I just remember growing up, he bought me this webpage builder. And I was just obsessed with it. It was just so much fun putting together a really simple website. I mean, now it probably looks like crap, but it’s so much fun, the creative process and stuff.

Now I’m really thankful that he never pushed me to learn how to code, like in college or school. This is the first time I want to do this myself and not have anybody else push me. This is something that I personally want to do.
And it’s just cool. Seeing other people like me who are just like normal or non-tech, non-technical people learn to code. So yeah, I’d say imposter syndrome was definitely my main challenge.

**Schalk Neethling**

And I think it’s something that doesn’t ever really go away. Because again, I’m going back to this idea of being a beginner at something. I’ve written JavaScript for a long time, but in the recent year and a half, I started picking up TypeScript, and I feel like a complete newbie again.

I used to deal with types 10 years ago when I did Java. I left that behind and have not been thinking about this for a long time. Now though, TypeScript has come on the scene and is very popular. When creating APIs, TypeScript is excellent because it gives you that layer of protection. It says to the user of your API, “Hey, you’re trying to pass me a string, but I’m expecting an integer.”
So, it protects you from making mistakes even before you’ve written the code. So it’s great, but it’s a whole new way of thinking about writing JavaScript. And even though people say TypeScript is just a superset of JavaScript. But, it’s significantly different when you get into the details.

Seeing that you now have a job doing web development suggests that you have found some resources that have been useful to you and helped you learn. But, I also assume and correct me if I’m wrong, that you’ve gone from one industry to another, you most likely had to do a lot of this by yourself. It wasn’t like going to university and doing a computer science degree. So, what resources have you found particularly useful?

**Isabel Calabig**

It all kind of started out with Codecademy. I tried a free trial at first. And it was nice because their UI allows you to see the project and the instructions, and you also have your space to code. You can also see a live preview of the results of your code.

Seeing it all side by side made everything click. I could see that when I type this out, then this will pop up on the browser. So learning by actual coding helped. And then, from there, I went off to different resources like Scrimba and similar.

And YouTube, a lot of YouTube tutorials. I’m very cautious around YouTube tutorials because you can get so caught up with what is called “tutorial hell.”
But I don’t know; I feel as long as you understand the concept and the idea of what you’re coding. Why you’re coding it in a certain way, then things will start to click, and then you can make your own projects and such.

And so, I often worked through a tutorial by watching it, rewatching it, and watching it one more time. Then, when I feel that I understand what’s going on, I close the video and try to make something that revolves around the idea or the concept I learned in the video.

And so, in a way, I guess tutorial hell does not have to be hell. On the contrary, it can be helpful in some ways. So long as you apply what you learn with those kinds of resources. For example, for most of last year, I relied on YouTube, Codecademy, and Scrimba, and then I just kind of got lost.

I didn’t know where to go after HTML and CSS. I was looking on LinkedIn and saw many people in the tech community were active on Twitter. That was when I hopped on Twitter to see what was going on. After exploring different Twitter communities and such, I connected with my friend Elandra. She was doing a coding Bootcamp called the 100devs Bootcamp by Leon. 

I decided to hop on that too, and it has been great having more of a structure with my learning. I can see; oh, after CSS, you can move on to JavaScript. It’s a lot better than just creating my own roadmap. With so many different resources out there, I got overwhelmed. And many people were saying, oh, use this, that, or the other. After sticking to one Bootcamp, I can make connections with everything I’m learning. It’s like a puzzle, and all the technologies are individual puzzle pieces. A pathway allows you to easily see where each puzzle piece fits into the larger puzzle.

The one key thing is community. Within the Bootcamp and on Twitter, that has been such a huge help. I love how experienced web developers are willing to mentor and have coffee chats with anybody. It’s just so great. Knowing that you have people who have you back, you know. They have your best interest in mind and want to push you to be a good developer.

And so it’s so nice to have this kind of community that’s so supportive.

**Schalk Neethling**

It’s super to hear you say that. I’ve always been a little weary of the industry not being as friendly and welcoming. Especially when we talk about the wider community. I’ve always wondered what the experience is like from the perspective of the “non-traditional” tech worker.

You hear a lot of horror stories, right? Especially women in tech. I’ve heard a lot of stories about the toxicity of social media. I’ve always been like, how do we approach this? How do we fix this? Or at least improve it. So it’s great for me to hear that you’ve had this positive experience.

That leads us nicely to the next question. As you said, there are so many resources and so many possible routes you can take. So, with all that in mind and all you have learned, what has been particularly challenging for you?

**Isabel Calabig**

Honestly, I don’t think anything is missing because everybody learns differently. Hence the various amounts of resources out there. However, I believe it is essential for beginners to understand if they purchase a course or take a class. It does not guarantee that you will get a job in tech right out of the door. There should be a fine print for every kind of class or course out there that says it depends.

Because it really depends on the person, how they learn, and how they apply their knowledge to projects. Mental health was such a huge thing for me to navigate when it came to coding and just the job hunt. It can be very draining, you know, and I guess it also depends on your network and who is in it.

So yeah, there should be a fine print saying it depends. I think it’s really misleading when ads say, “oh, you’ll get a job in tech right after you complete X, Y, and Z.” It’s just false advertising. It’s just not realistic. It really depends on the person’s process.

**Schalk Neethling**

There are quite a couple of those going around. There’s actually one that I personally just classify as a scam. They advertise that if you are a junior, you can join as a paid intern. So you send your resume to the company, and they get back to you and say, “oh, unfortunately, you didn’t quite make the cut. But if you take our 200 Euro course and you do really well, there might be a job for you.” I also saw this like on a Slack channel for junior developers. Thankfully I could warn people about what happened to a friend of mine. So I don’t want to demotivate people, but do be careful. The old adage, “If it sounds good to be true, it’s probably not true,” applies here.

One of the other traps people also fall prey to with tech is the promise of immediate riches. While there is an opportunity to make good money, the work is hard. If you don’t enjoy it, the novelty of the paycheque will dry up. You’re going to get frustrated and possibly even end up hating it. The thing is, there is a lot more to a career in tech than writing code. You need to enjoy problem-solving.

One of the things you mentioned earlier was being tired from all the interviews and the whole process. That’s another part of the industry that needs addressing. It almost feels like the interview process is stuck in the nineties. The industry has changed so much, and the interview process has not evolved. So what do you see as the primary problems in this regard? What makes you nervous or scared about the interview process, and what would you like to see changed?

**Isabel Calabig**

Yeah. When it comes to the interview process in general, no matter the industry, you should pay attention to the kind of company you’re interested in. I feel like many people nowadays kind of mass apply to a bunch of different companies, fill out all these forms, and expect immediate results.

I just feel like that’s not the best approach. I’ve heard of people who get lucky with that process, but I think it’s vital to be very careful. Think about what industry you want to get into and pay attention to the people in that industry and the products in that industry, you know? And so, I feel that’ll also be easier on the applicant themselves as they can focus on one sector, one general idea of what should be on the resume.

And I think with job interviews, when it comes to technical things, there should be more resources out there for learning how to approach the more technical side of interviews. For myself, I needed to work really hard to remember the technical words. I found that blogging really helps, writing out my thinking process. I really enjoy thinking of ways to simplify complex concepts, and I always have. I also have friends proofread it to see if it makes sense and provide feedback. 

And it’s cool, just being able to practice that.
Another thing that should change, which is kind of hard, because I know recruiters are just so busy. But, I think it’s just so important not to leave applicants on red, you know, or to give them a generic email that doesn’t provide any kind of feedback. It’s such a complex process to solve, but I feel that there should be a templated email of some sort that addresses the type of projects that they’re expecting or something like that. 

I’ve had a few friends applying for internships and dev jobs. They got the same templated email response from seemingly different employers. That made me sad because I was thinking, well, that doesn’t help, you know? And so, I don’t know, it’s hard. It’s a highly complex process. I don’t know what could be a good solution for something like that.

I just feel that it’s so sad when applicants get left on red, or they’re just given that templated kind of response that has no feedback whatsoever.

**Schalk Neethling**

Yeah, for sure. I feel that you should at least get back to people and keep them in the loop. Even if it’s just an email to say that we are still talking to applicants, we haven’t made a decision yet, and we’ll get back to you. Also, I think it is essential to get back to people when the job is filled; even if they didn’t get the job, just let them know it has been filled.

Being a bit more human, I think, is what it boils down to. But, unfortunately, sometimes things become so processed, not just food but real life, that humanity is processed right out of it.

**Isabel Calabig**

Yeah, that’s so true.

**Schalk Neethling**

It’s also not always a reflection of the company. For example, I’ve worked at companies where the interview process was pretty terrible, but the engineering group and the people in engineering are wonderful people. It’s just that there is a big gap between HR and the people doing the work.

You might often get a misperception of the company based on your interactions with the recruiting side. Often the recruiting side isn’t even part of the company you are applying to. A lot of this is often outsourced.

For them, it’s often about how many people you can place because the company receives a portion of the salary for every person they successfully place. It’s a complicated problem, that is for sure.

Related to that, some people might say, you know what, I’m just gonna forego the whole interview process and start my own business. And that is the question I have for people: Would you work for someone or start your own business? But I think the bigger question I’m trying to get at is, what does success look like to you? You’ve changed your career. You’re in a new industry. So when you look at your future, what does success look like for you?

**Isabel Calabig**

Just to address the first part, when it comes to either wanting to start a business or join an existing company. I’ve thought about starting a business, but I don’t know; it sounds so stressful. I think you would need to have the right people on your side. Just thinking about funds and stuff like that, I don’t want to stress about that kind of stuff right now. So I don’t know, I’m drawn to businesses or companies that have a product that I trust and believe in.

Moving beyond that, the company culture is essential to me. Like DreamBox, we’re passionate about diversity and ensuring that people feel heard and represented. I love everything our company does to ensure everyone is seen, you know? And so that’s something that I love about any kind of company. They’re not afraid to show off their diverse and inclusive culture. It’s just so great.
And they’re not afraid to address the hard stuff that’s going on in the world. Our company takes an hour or so a month to just talk about the hard stuff that happens in the world. Like we talked about black lives matter, things happening in Ukraine, there’s just so much happening, and it’s so important for companies to be involved in that. 

So, it’s definitely more than just the company’s products. It’s their culture and their values. I also love the structure of an organization. I just find a lot of comfort in that for myself. When it comes to success, I’d say that success is celebrating even the smallest victories that may seem lame or small, you know, and it’s all about perspective. I remember when I was just starting out to learn how to code, imposter syndrome would just like hit me all the time. And I needed to figure out a way to get out of that, like mental state to keep going, you know? And I actually kept a, well, I still keep a journal that just documents little things that I’ve accomplished throughout my life or like my career or my day. And that helps, like every little step you take, that’s such a big deal. And even if it feels like you’re going back sometimes, look at all the stuff you’ve done already, you know, it’s all about perspectives.

So yeah, I think keeping the little things in mind helps keep me going.

**Schalk Neethling**

I kind of started doing that as well some time ago. I felt that often a week or so would go by, and I would ask myself, “What did I do in the last week? I was busy and I hardly had time for anything, but what did I do?.” So I started jotting them down using a Kanban board where I have items in the backlog, things in progress, and done items. At the end of the week, I look at your done column, and I can see all the work that I have done.
I think it’s great to go back and celebrate your own accomplishments.

Even if they’re small, even if it’s like, I sent an email to this person that I never thought I would send an email to. So when I started this podcast, I constantly reached out to people, saying, “I hope it’s okay to reach out to you in this way.”

You have to get past that and just contact them over Twitter and hope they’re not like, “How dare you slide into my DMS.” So I think one needs to do that it’s helpful to step outside of your comfort zone. There is a member of the Mycelium Network community that keeps a diary of his whole learning journey. It’s a website where he shares everything he’s learning and the struggles he encounters. It’s so interesting. And for others to read that and see that sometimes things are rough. Personal events happened that made them not feel like learning, or you sometimes just hit a wall. You just hit a wall and feel like you will never be able to figure this out. Then one morning, you wake up, and it just clicks. Like closure in JavaScript. It’s one of those topics where you are just baffled, and then one day, it all falls into place.
I think it’s good to keep a clear perspective about all these things. Talking about that, I saw another tweet of yours where you said you’re working on a mini math word problem game. How is that going?

**Isabel Calabig**

Yeah. It’s, it’s going. It’s a lot of work. I feel like my mind is just so; I have such a creative mind when it comes to design. I’m so focused on CSS and styling that an hour passes by and I’m like, oh wait, crap, I need to work on the JavaScript part too.

And so it’s going well. I’m enjoying all the different kinds of stuff that I’m learning in JavaScript. I hope to develop this math game for kids to practice math and reading comprehension. Because, at least for me, I know growing up when it came to math word problems, oh my goodness. Well, first off, math was just not my strongest subject, but combining math and reading, was hard.
You had to understand the text and understand what the question is asking for. It’s a long-term kind of project, but I hope to develop it and make it available for anybody who has kids or is a kid and wants to practice. So, it kind of goes in line with my passion for ed tech. So it works out that way too.

**Schalk Neethling**

Yeah. Keep going and keep people up to date on Twitter as it evolves. I also have a lot of side projects. Much like you mentioned earlier about getting a job when you walk out of a BootCamp, there is also a misconception about side projects. Some people think you’re gonna start a side project, get up the next day, and the project has a hundred stars and people applauding you on Twitter, and it’s just not true.

Sometimes you’re going to build something and like it’s crickets. But it’s okay because you’re learning, and as long as you’re making something that’s useful for you, it doesn’t really matter. So if, after 10 years, somebody stumbles upon it and is like, oh my goodness, look at this and finds it useful, that’s already worth it.

It doesn’t always have to be something that turns into the next Twitter or the next “insert successful company here.” It can sometimes just be fun, scratches an itch, and helps you learn something new.

So, if you could recommend one resource, be it a book, online course, YouTube channel, or anything like that, to early-stage learners, what would that resource be?

**Isabel Calabig**

Definitely 100devs the Bootcamp. If you feel like you’re good going on your own, you don’t have to join the Bootcamp, but even just listening and watching the 100devs YouTube channel, Leon is just such a great instructor. He knows how to break things down into little pieces and simplify things.

I remember when I came across his first 100devs video, the main thing I got out of it was you have to understand how you learn. So what is the best way for you to understand these kinds of concepts? Is it by coding? Is it by reviewing flashcards?

You really have to understand how you learn best, and then you can move forward. I’m not strictly following the Bootcamp in order because there are other things that I also want to learn, but it was just such a good foundation. I need to step back and figure out, How do I learn? How do I take information in the best?

I love taking notes, but the kind of notes I make are like flow charts. That is the best way for me to understand how things like work. I always need a visual, and then I’ll be able to pick it up. And sometimes flashcards work for me. It depends on what I am learning. Doing projects and making flow charts really help solidify complex concepts.

**Schalk Neethling**

If you’re a visual learner, things like flow charts work well. For me as well, I can’t learn something for the sake of learning. I have to have a purpose for it. I’m going to create a project, or I have a potential client, and I’m gonna need to know X to do the work. Then I jump in to learn because I can learn and apply, learn and apply. And the other side of that is writing about it. The combination of those three things for me personally is how it sticks.

I need to do it very practically. I can’t just learn algorithms because maybe I’d need to answer that in an interview. That’s draining for me to try and do that kind of stuff. I don’t know; I’m not working on a search engine or building machine learning models. I don’t strictly need algorithms for the work I do.

So we’re close to starting to wrap this up. So a new question is, if you could nominate someone I should speak to on this show, who would that be?

**Isabel Calabig**

My dev mentor, his name’s Allen Villa. He’s honestly just such a great resource. Like he’s been guiding me in my professional career, and we have a very similar background. He also has a background in marketing, and I remember the first coffee chat I had with him. He encouraged me to use my marketing skills to get into tech. So he was like, you already know HTML and CSS. You can use that to build email templates. You can be like an email template developer.

It’s not like an actual dev job, but it’s a start. Knowing a little bit of HTML and CSS can give you a start in tech, and I feel that not many people realize that. So I would say him for sure. He has such a great life story, and he’s also a really friendly guy, super outgoing, and loves life and coding. Like he’s just so good.

**Schalk Neethling**

Before we wrap up, please tell us about any projects you’re working on. Anything you’d like people to know about? Your own website or anything you’re excited about that you’re working on.

**Isabel Calabig**

I’m currently working on two big projects. First, there’s one that’s called the study-break reflection app. The app’s goal is to keep a students’ stress levels in check and encourage them to ask for help when they get really stressed.

Because I know, at least like for me, sometimes stress prevents me from asking for help. So I have a lot of ideas for how this app can play out, but yeah, that’s the gist of it. And then my other one, as you said, is a math game.

**Schalk Neethling**

Great stuff. Thanks so much again for joining. It was fantastic to talk to you.

**Isabel Calabig**

Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
